<p>I have a few older AS/400 machines, however, their SCSI disks are starting to<br>go to data-heaven, and it&#39;s getting increasingly hard to find the right disks.<br>IBM forces you to use the right types of disks for your machine, ruling out<br>third party replacement disks. To complicate matters even more, a non-standard<br>sector size is being used.</p>
<p>However, there is a neat SCSI-to-SD adapter from [codesrc<br><a href="http://www.codesrc.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=SCSI2SD">http://www.codesrc.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=SCSI2SD</a>] which is based on a<br>Cypress microcontroller, and the firmware is Open Source. Since my machine is<br>only a hobbyist machine, I don&#39;t expect heavy load, so it should be possible to<br>just run it off a couple of SD cards using this. Due to the OSS nature, it<br>should also be feasible to add the non-standard IBM gimmicks.</p>

<p>I ordered two SCSI2SD cards today, and a bunch of adapters to connect them.<br>They should arrive at mine&#39;s during the next couple of days, however, it might<br>have a bit of a delay due to the holiday season.</p>
