<p>I have a few older AS/400 machines, however, their SCSI disks are starting to<br>go to data-heaven, and it&#39;s getting increasingly hard to find the right disks.<br>IBM forces you to use the right types of disks for your machine, ruling out<br>third party replacement disks. To complicate matters even more, a non-standard<br>sector size is being used.</p>
<p>However, there is a neat SCSI-to-SD adapter from <a href="http://www.codesrc.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=SCSI2SD">codesrc</a> which is based on a<br>Cypress microcontroller, and the firmware is Open Source. Since my machine is<br>only a hobbyist machine, I don&#39;t expect heavy load, so it should be possible to<br>just run it off a couple of SD cards using this. Due to the OSS nature, it<br>should also be feasible to add the non-standard IBM gimmicks.</p>

<p>I connected two same-sized IBM-branded disks to a Sun machine with a working<br>SCSI controller, and discovered that the following VPD tables are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>0x3</li>
<li>0xc0</li>
<li>0xc4</li>
<li>di</li>
<li>iod</li>
<li>sn</li>
</ul>
<p>The 0xc0 table contained the following information on the disks:</p>
<p>disk A:<br>    00000000  00 c0 00 14 00 00 00 41  20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20  |.......A        |<br>    00000010  20 01 00 04 01 0c 00 00                           | .......|<br>    00000018<br>disk B:<br>    00000000  00 c0 00 14 00 00 00 41  20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20  |.......A        |<br>    00000010  20 01 00 04 01 0c 00 00                           | .......|<br>    00000018</p>

<p>I ordered two SCSI2SD cards today, and a bunch of adapters to connect them.<br>They should arrive at mine&#39;s during the next couple of days, however, it might<br>have a bit of a delay due to the holiday season.</p>
